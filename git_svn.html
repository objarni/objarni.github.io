<h1>How I use git inside svn repositories</h1>

<i>My purpose of using git at all inside of a svn repository is to enable a "local branches" workflow,
which just is the way I like to work with source code (thinking of a specific bug fix, feature add and
so on at a time, while still enabling fetching changes from upstream anytime I want to, e.g. daily).
So the git repository is never pushed anywhere - it just lives locally, inside of the checked out svn
repository folder, like so:</i>

<pre>
    C:\prj\project\                # projects root folder
    C:\prj\project\subfolder       # some subproject with source code etc.
    C:\prj\project\.svn            # this goes in the root and all subdirs
    C:\prj\project\subfolder\.svn  #  ...
    C:\prj\project\.git            # lives parallell to .svn; make sure you svn ignore it!
    C:\prj\project\.gitignore      # Make sure you ignore .svn, and svn ignore this one too
</pre>

<h3>What does gits' master branch mean then?</h3>
Conceptually, you keep the master branch of your git repository in sync with svn, and then you rebase
your feature branches on master as soon as you svn up. It can therefore be thought of as the
"main svn log" of the workflow.

<h3>Working on local branches</h3>
This is basically as any git workflow: create a branch, check it out, make some changes and commit continually.

<h3>Fetching changes from svn repo</h3>
This is the toughest part of the workflow as it involves merging changes (merges are always a pain!).

In theory, what you want to do is:

<ul>
<li>Verify your feature branch is clean, i.e. no uncommitted or untracked files (git status)</li>
<li>Go to git master branch (git checkout master)</li>
<li>Perform a svn up command, getting latest changes from your mates</li>
<li>Add these changes to the git master branch (git add . then commit with auto message)</li>
<li>Jump back to your feature branch (git checkout myfeature)</li>
<li>Rebase on master (git rebase master)</li>
</ul>

NOTE: This should only be done when you have a clean workspace (nothing un-committed). That is step one.

NOTE 2: The svn up command that happens here should *never* cause a merge conflict, as you are only updating from a previous state of the svn repository, to a newer, as you are keeping your changes on other branches than master.

A lot of those steps are the same every time - robot work. So to make it a little
less mundane, I've written a small bash script that automates the robotic parts of it, see end of this page. The svnup script is used like this:

<pre>   $ ./svnup mybranch</pre>

If you get merge conflicts during rebase, use any text editor to fix the conclicts, then <b>git add</b> the file,
and <b>git rebase --continue</b>.


<h3>.gitignore</h3>
Some examples of what I put in .gitignore:

<ul>
<li>old binary folders and similar, to speed up git workflow</li>
<li>svnup bash script</li>
</ul>

Examplefile:
<pre>
    .svn
    Binaries/
    svnup
    *.obj
</pre>


<h3>Committing changes to svn repo</h3>

As with any commit procedure make sure you are up-to-date with the latest changes from main before you commit, see fetching changes from svn repo.

After you've done that, solving all rebase issues and so on, you'd basically merge your feature branch changes to the master branch. Doing that
should be painless as you've already dealt with all merge issues on your feature branch (doing the rebasing). Finally, you're ready for svn commit.

In pseudo command lines:

<ul>
<li>./svnup myfeature</li>
<li>git checkout master
<li>git merge myfeature</li>
<li>svn add/remove (new/deleted files)</li>
<li>svn commit</li>
</ul>

<h3>The svnup bash script</h3>
A helper script that simplifies fetching and merging changes from the svn repository.

<pre>
# svnup git+svn utility script
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]] ; then
    echo 'Usage: svnup <branchname>'
    echo 'Helper script for git+svn. Will update the master branch with latest'
    echo 'changes from svn server, autocommit that to master, jump back to'
    echo '<branchname> and rebase on master. Stops immediately on any fail.'
    exit 1
fi

if [[ $1 == "master" ]]; then
        echo 'Cannot svnup on master branch, only other branches.'
        exit 1
fi

set -e
git checkout $1
git checkout master
svn up
git add .
git commit -m 'autocommit from svnup: changes from svn server' || true
git checkout $1
git rebase master
</pre>
